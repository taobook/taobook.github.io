### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++) {
            map.put(order.charAt(i), i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {//words.length-1
            for (int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++) {
                if (j >= words[i + 1].length()) return false;//apple, app
                if (words[i].charAt(j) == words[i + 1].charAt(j)) continue; //wait for next round
                if (map.get(words[i].charAt(j)) > map.get(words[i + 1].charAt(j))) return false;

                break;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}

```
The provided Java solution is designed to check whether a list of words is sorted according to a custom alien dictionary order. Let's go over the key parts of the code and its logic:

### Code Walkthrough:
1. **Creating the `order` map**:
    - A `Map<Character, Integer>` is created to map each character in the alien language to its index in the given order string.

   ```java
   Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++) {
       map.put(order.charAt(i), i);
   }
   ```
   This way, each character gets an integer representing its position in the alien dictionary.

2. **Comparing words**:
    - The outer `for` loop iterates over each adjacent pair of words (from `i` to `i+1`).
    - The inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++)`) compares characters of the two words at each position `j`.

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
       for (int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++) {
   ```
   It ensures each word is compared only to the next word in the list.

3. **Handling cases**:
    - If the first word is longer than the second word and the second word is a prefix of the first, it's considered not sorted, e.g., "apple" vs "app". This is handled with:
      ```java
      if (j >= words[i + 1].length()) return false;
      ```
    - If the characters at position `j` in both words are equal, the loop continues to the next character:
      ```java
      if (words[i].charAt(j) == words[i + 1].charAt(j)) continue;
      ```
    - If the character in the current word comes after the character in the next word in the alien order, return `false` because the list is not sorted:
      ```java
      if (map.get(words[i].charAt(j)) > map.get(words[i + 1].charAt(j))) return false;
      ```
    - If none of the conditions for sorting violation are met, the inner loop breaks and the algorithm proceeds to the next pair of words.

4. **Return true if all words are sorted**:
    - If no violations are found, return `true` at the end.

### Example Explanation:
Let's say we have the words `["hello", "leetcode"]` and the order `"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"`.

- The map is created with `'h' -> 0`, `'l' -> 1`, `'a' -> 2`, ..., `'z' -> 25`.
- Comparing `"hello"` and `"leetcode"`:
    - At `j = 0`, `'h'` in `"hello"` and `'l'` in `"leetcode"`. Since `map.get('h') < map.get('l')`, the comparison continues.
    - No other comparison is needed as the first character of `"hello"` is less than that of `"leetcode"` in the alien order.

Thus, the words are considered sorted, and `true` is returned.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: `O(N * M)`, where `N` is the number of words and `M` is the average length of a word. This is because each character in the words is compared once.
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding input data), as only a fixed-size map is used to store the 26 characters of the alien alphabet.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to check if the words are sorted according to a custom alien dictionary.
