# 42. Trapping Rain Water | M-41 | v

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;

        // Edge case: If the array is empty or too small, no water can be trapped.
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Create arrays to store the maximum heights from left and right for each index.
        int[] leftMax = new int[n];
        leftMax[0] = height[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i]);
        }

        int[] rightMax = new int[n];
        rightMax[n - 1] = height[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i]);
        }

        // Calculate the water trapped at each index
        int[] current = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            current[i] = Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i];
        }

        // Print debugging information
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(leftMax));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(rightMax));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(height));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(current));

        // Calculate the total water trapped
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res += current[i];
        }

        return res;
    }
}

The provided solution calculates the amount of trapped rainwater between the heights of the bars in a histogram, a common problem known as the **Trapping Rain Water** problem. The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute useful values for determining how much water can be trapped at each index.

Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

### Algorithm Overview

1.  **Precomputing Maximum Heights**:
    *   For each index `i`, you need to know the maximum height of the bars to the left of `i` and the maximum height to the right of `i`.
    *   This is stored in two arrays:
        *   `leftMax[]`: Stores the maximum height encountered from the left side up to each index.
        *   `rightMax[]`: Stores the maximum height encountered from the right side up to each index.
2.  **Calculating Trapped Water**:
    *   For each index `i`, the amount of water trapped at that index is determined by the minimum of `leftMax[i]` and `rightMax[i]`, minus the height of the bar at that index (`height[i]`).
    *   If the bar is taller than the minimum of the surrounding bars, no water is trapped at that index.
3.  **Summing the Water**:
    *   The total amount of water trapped is the sum of the water trapped at each index.



### Detailed Explanation:

1.  **Precomputing Left and Right Maximum Heights**:
    *   **LeftMax Array**: The `leftMax[i]` contains the maximum height from the left up to index `i`. For the first element, `leftMax[0]` is just the height at index `0`, since there are no elements to the left. For each subsequent element, it computes the maximum of the current element and the maximum height to the left.
    *   **RightMax Array**: Similarly, `rightMax[i]` contains the maximum height from the right up to index `i`. Starting from the last element, it computes the maximum height to the right.
2.  **Trapped Water Calculation**:
    *   For each index `i`, the trapped water is calculated as: $$trapped\\_water\[i\]=min⁡(leftMax\[i\],rightMax\[i\])−height\[i\]$$ This gives the height of water that can be stored at index `i`.
3.  **Summing the Total Trapped Water**:
    *   The total trapped water is computed by summing the trapped water at each index in the `current[]` array.

### Edge Case:

*   If the `height` array has a length of `0`, no water can be trapped, so the function returns `0`.

### Time Complexity:

*   **Time complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of bars in the input array. This is because we make three passes through the array: one to compute `leftMax`, one to compute `rightMax`, and one to calculate the trapped water.
*   **Space complexity**: `O(n)`, since we use two additional arrays (`leftMax[]` and `rightMax[]`) of size `n`.

### Example:

For the input array `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`:

*   `leftMax[]`: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
*   `rightMax[]`: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
*   The trapped water at each index is computed, and the total trapped water is `6`.

This solution efficiently computes the amount of trapped rainwater using dynamic programming.
