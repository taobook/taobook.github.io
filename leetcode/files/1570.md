# 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors | M-4

Your implementation of the `SparseVector` class with an optimized dot product computation is efficient and straightforward. Here's a brief breakdown of the code and some key points:

### Key Components:
1. **SparseVector Constructor**:
    - You construct the sparse vector by storing non-zero values along with their indices in a `HashMap`, where the key is the index and the value is the element at that index.

2. **dotProduct Method**:
    - The dot product is computed by iterating through the smaller `map` to minimize the number of lookups.
    - This optimization works because the fewer lookups you do in the larger map, the better the performance. You conditionally iterate through the map with fewer entries, comparing against the other map.

### Optimized Dot Product Logic:
The key efficiency improvement here is based on the following:
- If `map.size()` (the number of non-zero elements in the current vector) is smaller than `vec.map.size()`, you iterate over the smaller map. This reduces the number of lookups in the larger map, improving performance, especially when the size difference is significant.

### Example Code Review:

```java
class SparseVector {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map;

    SparseVector(int[] nums) {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                map.put(i, nums[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the dotProduct of two sparse vectors
    public int dotProduct(SparseVector vec) {
        int res = 0;
        // Iterate over the smaller map to minimize lookups in the other map
        if (map.size() < vec.map.size()) {
            for (int i : map.keySet()) {
                if (vec.map.containsKey(i)) {
                    res += map.get(i) * vec.map.get(i);
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int i : vec.map.keySet()) {
                if (map.containsKey(i)) {
                    res += map.get(i) * vec.map.get(i);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity for computing the dot product is `O(min(m, n))`, where `m` and `n` are the number of non-zero elements in the two vectors. This is because you are iterating over the smaller set of non-zero elements and performing constant-time operations for lookups and multiplications.

- **Space complexity**: The space complexity for storing each vector is `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of non-zero elements in the vector. You store the non-zero elements in a `HashMap`.

### Example Usage:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] nums1 = {1, 0, 0, 2, 3};
    int[] nums2 = {0, 3, 0, 4, 0};
    
    SparseVector v1 = new SparseVector(nums1);
    SparseVector v2 = new SparseVector(nums2);
    
    int result = v1.dotProduct(v2);  // Result will be 8
    System.out.println("Dot Product: " + result);
}
```

For `nums1 = [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]` and `nums2 = [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]`, the result will be `8` since the only matching non-zero index is `3`, where `2 * 4 = 8`.

### Summary:
This approach is an efficient way to compute the dot product of two sparse vectors, using a `HashMap` to store non-zero elements and optimizing lookups by iterating over the smaller map. It reduces both time complexity and unnecessary computations, particularly when the vectors are large and sparse.
