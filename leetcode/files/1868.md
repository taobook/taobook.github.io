### Solution Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findRLEArray(int[][] encoded1, int[][] encoded2) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int p1 = 0; // Pointer for encoded1
        int p2 = 0; // Pointer for encoded2

        int lastProduct = -1; // Track the last product
        int lastFrequent = 0; // Track the last frequency

        while (p1 < encoded1.length && p2 < encoded2.length) {
            // Calculate the product of the current pair
            int product = encoded1[p1][0] * encoded2[p2][0];
            // Determine the minimum frequency
            int frequent = Math.min(encoded1[p1][1], encoded2[p2][1]);

            // Merge with the previous product if it is the same
            if (lastProduct == product) {
                res.get(res.size() - 1).set(1, lastFrequent + frequent); // Update frequency
            } else {
                res.add(Arrays.asList(product, frequent)); // Add a new product-frequency pair
            }

            // Update the remaining frequencies for the current pairs
            encoded1[p1][1] -= frequent;
            encoded2[p2][1] -= frequent;

            // Move to the next pair if a frequency becomes zero
            if (encoded1[p1][1] == 0) p1++;
            if (encoded2[p2][1] == 0) p2++;

            // Update lastProduct and lastFrequent for the next iteration
            lastProduct = product;
            lastFrequent = frequent;
        }

        return res;
    }
}

The provided Java solution implements the **Run-Length Encoded (RLE) Array Multiplication** problem. The goal is to multiply two run-length encoded arrays and return a new run-length encoded array representing their product.

### Key Concepts:
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: This is a compression technique where consecutive elements with the same value are represented as pairs of (value, frequency). For example, an array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]` can be encoded as `[(1, 3), (2, 2)]`, where `1` appears 3 times and `2` appears 2 times.

### Problem Breakdown:
Given two arrays, `encoded1` and `encoded2`, both in run-length encoding, where each array is a list of pairs `[value, frequency]`, you need to return the product of the two arrays, also in run-length encoded form.

For each pair `(value1, freq1)` in `encoded1` and `(value2, freq2)` in `encoded2`, you multiply the values `value1 * value2` and use the smaller frequency `min(freq1, freq2)` to determine how many times the product should appear. If consecutive products are the same, you combine them.

### Approach:
1. Use two pointers (`p1` and `p2`) to iterate through `encoded1` and `encoded2` simultaneously.
2. Multiply the current values `encoded1[p1][0]` and `encoded2[p2][0]`.
3. Use the smaller of the two frequencies `encoded1[p1][1]` and `encoded2[p2][1]` as the frequency for this product.
4. If the product of the current pair matches the last product in the result, merge the frequencies. Otherwise, add the new product-frequency pair to the result.
5. Adjust the frequencies by subtracting the minimum frequency, and move the pointers when a frequency reaches zero.


### Explanation of the Key Steps:
1. **Multiplying values**: For each pair of values from `encoded1` and `encoded2`, we compute the product of their values.

2. **Determining the frequency**: The minimum frequency between the two pairs is taken to ensure the product only lasts as long as both elements have non-zero frequency.

3. **Merging consecutive identical products**: If the current product matches the last product added to the result, we update the last entry by adding the frequencies together. Otherwise, we create a new entry.

4. **Updating frequencies**: After computing the product, we reduce the frequencies of the current pairs by the amount used (`frequent`), and if a frequency reaches zero, the pointer is incremented to the next pair.

5. **Final result**: The result is a list of pairs, where each pair represents the product and its run-length frequency.

### Example:

Let's consider the example where:
- `encoded1 = [[1, 3], [2, 3]]` (this corresponds to `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`)
- `encoded2 = [[2, 3], [3, 3]]` (this corresponds to `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`)

The result of multiplying these two encoded arrays will be:

```
Step 1: 1 * 2 = 2 (for frequency 3) → [2, 3]
Step 2: 2 * 3 = 6 (for frequency 3) → [6, 3]
```

Thus, the result is `[[2, 3], [6, 3]]`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `encoded1` and `encoded2`, respectively. Each pair is processed once, so the time complexity depends on the total number of elements in both arrays.

- **Space complexity**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of product pairs in the result.
