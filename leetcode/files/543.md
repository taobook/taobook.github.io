# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree | M-25 | v

### Solution:

```java
class Solution {

    private int res = 0; // This will store the maximum diameter

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        // Compute the height of the tree, during which we calculate the diameter
        height(root);
        return res; // Return the final maximum diameter found
    }
    
    private int height(TreeNode root) {
        // Base case: if the node is null, its height is 0
        if (root == null) return 0;

        // Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees
        int left = height(root.left);
        int right = height(root.right);

        // Update the global maximum diameter
        // The diameter at the current node is the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees
        res = Math.max(res, left + right);

        // Return the height of the current node, which is the max height of its subtrees + 1
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}

```


Your implementation of calculating the diameter of a binary tree is on point. It correctly uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the height of each subtree while simultaneously computing the diameter. Here's a detailed explanation of how your solution works:

### Explanation of the Code:

1.  **Class Variables:**
    *   `res`: This variable stores the maximum diameter encountered during the DFS traversal.
2.  `diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root)` **Method:**
    *   This method calls the `height()` helper method on the root of the tree.
    *   After traversing the tree and calculating the height, `res` will contain the diameter of the binary tree.
    *   The method returns `res`, which is the final result.
3.  `height(TreeNode root)` **Method:**
    *   This is a recursive method that computes the height of the binary tree. It returns the height of the current subtree, which is defined as the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees plus 1.
    *   While calculating the height, it also computes the diameter:
        *   The diameter at any node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees (`left + right`), representing the longest path through that node.
        *   It updates `res` if the diameter of the current node is greater than the previously computed diameter.
4.  **Base Case:**
    *   If the current node (`root`) is `null`, the height is `0`, because an empty subtree has no height.


### Key Points:

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once to compute its height and update the diameter.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), this can be as bad as **O(n)**.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the tree:

```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

*   At node 4 and 5: `left = 0`, `right = 0`, height returned is `1`.
*   At node 2: `left = 1`, `right = 1`, `res = 2` (diameter is updated), height returned is `2`.
*   At node 3: `left = 0`, `right = 0`, height returned is `1`.
*   At node 1: `left = 2`, `right = 1`, `res = 3` (final diameter is `3`).

Thus, the diameter (longest path) is the path that passes through nodes `4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`, which has a length of 3.

### Conclusion:

Your approach is efficient and correctly computes the diameter of a binary tree. This solution leverages DFS to compute the height of subtrees while updating the diameter, making it optimal in both time and space. Keep it up!
